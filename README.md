# Nucleo-Board-with-PLC-Extension

•	In this project, we will evaluate the possibility of making a STM micro-controller system to behave like a PLC system with a cycle of 10 ms. 
•	The board used in this project is the Nucleo-64 STM32F446RET6. 
•	The expansion board used for making this possible is the X-NUCLEO-PLC01A1. 
•	The development environment for this project is Keil IDE. 
•	 An implementation for a traffic light application will be run to check the feasibility of the method.
